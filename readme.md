I created a basic trivia game to test general music knowledge.
I chose to place all my questions in html and have them list style
rather than read the questions one by one.  I will in the future try
to change the code in this or in another project to incorporate selecting
different questions via either keystroke or clicking a button. The basis of the
trivia game was to create buttons with corresponding answers and make arrays
using the user input and match with the correct answers to determine the score.
I was able to make it display the score when the correct answers are chosen however,
if someone took the quiz and got them all wrong it would would not grade the quiz
and instead would still say 'Your Score'.  





As a user I should be able to take this quiz so that I can test my knowledge.
As a user I should be able to understand the directions so I can take the quiz correctly.
As a user I should be able to click on a button to choose my answer.
As a user I should be able to read the questions clearly in order to better understand what they are asking.
As a user I should be able to read my score so I can determine how well I did on the quiz.
